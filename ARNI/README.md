# ARNI -- Algorithm for Revealing Network Interactions

The Algorithm for Revealing Network Interactions (ARNI) is the algorithm used in the article [Model-free inference of direct network interactions from nonlinear collective dynamics, Nature Communications 8, 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02288-4). 

Relying only on nonlinear collective dynamics, ARNI reveals the interaction topology of networks without neither assuming specific dynamic models to be known in advance nor assuming the dynamics admits a sparse representation, nor imposing controlled drivings on the network. 

In this repository, you will find example codes and functions implemented in Matlab and Python.

We thank Alexander Calderwood (Computational and Systems Biology Group, John Innes Centre, UK) for providing the Python implementations.
